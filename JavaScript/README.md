Javascript is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.


- JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
- Designed for creating network-centric applications.
- Complementary to and integrated with Java.
- Complementary to and integrated with HTML.
- Open and cross-platform

Advantages of JavaScript:
1. Less server interaction
2. Immediate feedback to the visitors
3. Increased interactivity
4. Richer interfaces − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.

Limitations of JavaScript:
1. Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.
2. JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available.
3. JavaScript doesn't have any multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities.

- JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and newlines that appear in JavaScript programs.
- Semicolons are Optional - however, allows you to omit this semicolon if each of your statements are placed on a separate line.
- JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.


JavaScript Datatypes:
1. Numbers, eg. 123, 120.50 etc.
2. Strings of text e.g. "This text string" etc.
3. Boolean e.g. true or false.

Object Oriented Programming:
1. Encapsulation − the capability to store related information, whether data or methods, together in an object.
2. Aggregation − the capability to store one object inside another object.
3. Inheritance − the capability of a class to rely upon another class (or number of classes) for some of its properties and methods.
4. Polymorphism − the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of different ways.


User-Defined Objects:
- The new operator is used to create an instance of an object.
var employee = new Object();
var books = new Array("C++", "Perl", "Java");
var day = new Date("August 15, 1947");
- The Object() Constructor:
A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object.
JavaScript provides a special constructor function called Object() to build the object.

- setTimeout( function, duration) − This function calls function after duration milliseconds from now.

- setInterval(function, duration) − This function calls function after every duration milliseconds.

- clearTimeout(setTimeoutvariable) − This function calls clears any timer set by the setTimeout() functions.
